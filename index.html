    <p>Now this is a begining of something great!</p>
    <p>
      I've always wanted to build websites that will solve real issues, and
      fortunately, in the community i've been posted to, there are many schools,
      non govermental organizations, and small companies that really need a
      website. After a few months of dedicated leaning, I'm going to invade all
      these organization and build something for them.

    <p>
      I will start with building a website for my ppa to <b>practice</b>, hehe.
      i repeat TO PRACTICE.

    <h3>
      Now i'm not too focused on the money, i just want to learn this thing and
      solve these problems i'm seeing, these small organizations need to scale
      up and feel global.

      There are many reasons why many people back out from great ventures such
      as this!

    <ol>
      <li>They will get weary because they are soing it alone</li>
      <li>They will become so inconsistent till they eventually give up</li>
      <li>They will lose track and fall behind</li>
      <li>They will give in to distractions and get drowned in it</li>
      <li>
        They will experience a little setback and see it as the end of the road
